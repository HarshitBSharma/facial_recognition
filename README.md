# facial_recognition
A simple code to recognize faces using the library "facial_recognition" in Python

Steps:
1) Install the libraries using the requirements.txt file
2) Place the faces you want to recognize in the Known_faces folder. These images should only contain one face, and it should be a clear image to get better results
3) Place the image with faces you want to recognize in the unknown faces directory, and run the code
4) Have fun :)
